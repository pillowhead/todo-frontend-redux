## Installation

- clone this repository
- `npm install`
- `npm start` will start server on `http://localhost:3000`

- modify rename setup, so that input field can be hidden without renaming task.

## Known issue

- when renaming/editing a task, it's necessary to rename to something else, otherwise the input field doesn't disappear.
